# Graphs

Let me show you a graph (from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics))):

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/6n-graf.svg"/>

As you can see, it is simply a representation of two sets:

1. A set of **vertices** or **nodes**. In the image above you see the nodes _1_, _2_, _3_, _4_, _5_, and _6_.
2. A set of **edges** or **links**. In the image above, the links are connecting pairs of nodes. 

Altogether, a _graph_ reveals some _relationship_ among the _nodes_. The graph structure will allow us to explore and understand that relationship. 

## Creating Graphs

The graph above can be represented computationally in R using **igraph**:

```{r}
library(igraph)

G = graph_from_edgelist(matrix( c(1, 2, 1, 5,2,5,2,3,3,4,4,5,4,6),
                                ncol = 2, 
                                byrow = TRUE),
                        directed = FALSE)
```


## Basic Elements

**G** is the graph:


```{r}
#basic info:
G
```


```{r}
# You see nodes

V(G)
```


```{r}
# You see edges
E(G)
```

## Drawing

As you can see, the graph is created by adding pairs of nodes. Once you complete that stage, you can draw the graph:


```{r}
# draw
V(G)$color='white'
E(G)$color='blue'
plot(G)
```

Notice that the position of the nodes will vary every time you re draw the graph. In fact, drawing a graph can become a challenge by itself when we need to find information via visualization. 

### Edge directionality

The graph we created and drew represented an **undirected** graph, that is, the relationships between a pair of nodes are **symmetric**: the relationships can not represent direction because they are _inherently mutual_ between the nodes. For example, the relationship *to be a neighbor of* is symmetric.

The following graph is **directed**:

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Directed_graph_no_background.svg/340px-Directed_graph_no_background.svg.png"/>


You can create this directed graph just by changing one parameter:


```{r}

dG = graph_from_edgelist(matrix( c(1, 2, 1, 3,3,2,3,4,4,3),
                                ncol = 2, 
                                byrow = TRUE),
                        directed = TRUE)



# drawing
V(dG)$color='white'
E(dG)$color='blue'
plot(dG)

```

Directed links are also called **arcs**. Notice the _Directed graph_ created represents an **asymmetric** relationship: the relationship a node has with another node does not need to be mutual, but could be (see nodes _3_ and _4_). If the arcs represent **cares for someone**, it shows that the feeling is not reciprocal for most cases in this graph. If a relationship is not mutual, and can only be in one direction, it is called **anti symmetric**.

## Attributes

Nodes can have attributes:


```{r}
# adding attributes
V(dG)$sex=c('male','male','female','female')
```


```{r}
# seeing attributes
V(dG)$sex
```

Attributes can serve for some computational purposes, but also help to visually find structures.


```{r}
# using node attributes
# Generate colors based on media type:
colorsSex <- c("red", "green")
V(dG)$color <- colorsSex[as.factor(V(dG)$sex)]
plot(dG)
```

Of course, edges can have attributes too:


```{r}

E(dG)$weight=c(1,3,5,10,2)

```


```{r}
# see them
E(dG)$weight
```


Let's use edge attributes:


```{r}
plot(dG,edge.width=E(dG)$weight)
```


## Exporting

You may want to export your graph to be visualized in Gephi or something similar:


```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
where=file.path('data',"dG_R.graphml")
write_graph(EliteNet,where, "graphml")
```



# Case: Elites in Peru

The network we are going to build is based on the relationships studied in this paper:
<img src='https://github.com/PythonVersusR/DataStructures_graphs/blob/main/images/paper.png?raw=true' width="900">


In that paper, Professor Figueroa shows this table, where 1 represents that both nodes (families) appear together at least once in a top company board. Notice the last column is an attribute:

<img src="https://github.com/PythonVersusR/DataStructures_graphs/blob/main/images/dataRed.png?raw=true" width="900">


This is an spreadsheet, representing the information above:

<img src="https://github.com/PythonVersusR/DataStructures_graphs/blob/main/images/dataExcel.png?raw=true" width="900">


Let's use the data from the spreadsheet to prepare our table:

```{r}
library(rio)

file=file.path('data','dataFigueroa.xlsx')

FigueData=import(file)
```



We got this:


```{r}
head(FigueData)
```

As intended, the family appears as the row index (not the first column of data). The family is also the column names:


```{r}
names(FigueData)
```

```{r}
row.names(FigueData)=FigueData[,1]
FigueData[,1]=NULL
head(FigueData)
```


The  FigueData **adjacency matrix** does not need the attribute column, then:


```{r}
varsToDrop=c('Multinacional')
varsToKeep=setdiff(names(FigueData),varsToDrop)
adjacency=FigueData[,varsToKeep] 

#result
head(adjacency)
```

It is easy to turn the adjacency matrix into a graph:


a. This data is currently  a _data frame_, and  has now to be converted into a **matrix**.

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
adjacency_Mx=as.matrix(adjacency) 
```


b. From this kind of structure (the adjacency _matrix_), we can easily create a network via **Igraph**:

```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
EliteNet=graph.adjacency(adjacency_Mx,mode="undirected",
                         diag = F, # no diagonal
                         weighted = NULL)
```


Take a look at **EliteNet**:


```{r}
# nodes:
V(EliteNet) #count of vertices
```


```{r}
# edges:
E(EliteNet)
```


```{r}
plot.igraph(EliteNet,
            vertex.color = 'yellow',
            edge.color='lightblue')
```


Let's add the attributes to the nodes:


```{r}
V(EliteNet)$Multinacional=FigueData$Multinacional
```



Updated nodes:


```{r}
V(EliteNet)$Multinacional
```


```{r}
# using node attributes
V(EliteNet)$color=V(EliteNet)$Multinacional

plot(EliteNet)
```

Trying a different layout:

```{r}
plot(EliteNet, layout=layout.circle)
```

Let's export this graph:


```{r}
where=file.path('data',"EliteNetR.graphml")
write_graph(EliteNet,where, "graphml")
```
